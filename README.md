Why This Exists?

Because pycowsay was cute…
…but my ASCII characters deserved more personality.

So I built a CLI tool that shouts your messages with style, attitude, and custom ASCII art.
No limits. No rules. Just pure ASCII fun.

Fork it. Break it. Add your own creatures.
Make ASCII great again.
